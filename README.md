# Burnout-Rate-Prediction-Heroku-Project

**Case Study**

Happy and healthy employees are undoubtedly more efficient at work. They assist the company to thrive. However, the scenario in most of the companies has changed with the pandemic. Since work from home, over 69% of the employees have been showing burnout symptoms (survey source: Monster). The burnout rate is indeed alarming. Many companies are taking steps to ensure their employees stay mentally healthy. As a solution to this, weâ€™ll build a web app that can be used by companies to monitor the burnout of their employees. Also, the employees themselves can use it to keep a check on their burnout rate (no time to assess the mental health in the fast work-life ðŸ˜”).
